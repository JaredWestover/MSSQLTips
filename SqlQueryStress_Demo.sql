Is the index worth it?

Is the change worth the effort?

SQL people will say, of course, it's worth the effort. Going from 75ms to 5ms is huge.

But how can we show the value?

📢*********BIG IDEA**********📢

We can use SqlQueryStress to express the performance impact at a larger scale.

Plus, SqlQueryStress is easier to use than something like JMeter.


Let's examine it now.
